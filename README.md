# Performance Dashboard 📊  

## 📌 About This Project  

### Overview  
This project analyzes the **sales, marketing, and product performance** of **VTech**, a global technology company.  
Using **Power BI as a complete analytics environment**, I transformed **raw transactional and marketing data** into **four interactive dashboards** that reveal:  

- **Overall business health** → Revenue, profit, deals closed, and targets met  
- **Customer & marketing performance** → Campaign ROI, satisfaction, and conversion rates  
- **Product insights** → Top performers, revenue vs. target, and profitability dynamics  
- **Transactional deep dive** → Searchable report with drill-through capability  

Each dashboard includes **YoY comparisons (absolute, % change, and growth rate)** across **2022, 2023, and partial 2024 (Jan–Aug)**.

## 📊 Dashboard 1: Business Overview  
🎯 **What’s the big picture of sales & revenue performance?**  

![Business_Overview](https://github.com/Osisehh/Performance-Dashboard/blob/main/Images/Dashboard%201.jpg)

**KPIs:**  
- **2022:** Revenue $601K, Profit $132K, Margin **22.0%**  
- **2023:** Revenue $630K (+4.8% vs PY), Profit $136K (+3.1% vs PY), Margin **21.7% (-1.5% vs PY)**  
- **2024 (YTD Aug):** Revenue $410K (-34.9% vs PY), Profit $86K (-37.2% vs PY), Margin **20.9% (-3.5% vs PY)**  

**Key Visuals & Insights:**  
- **Revenue Trend:** Peaks in Jan 2022 ($55.9K), Apr 2023 ($65K), and Mar 2024 ($59.5K)  
- **Regional Split:** Europe consistently leads; weakest regions shift (North America in 2022, South America in 2023, France in 2024)  
- **Sales Channel:** Online dominates across all years (**~66–68% of total revenue**)  

**Key Takeaway:**  
Business **grew steadily from 2022 to 2023**, but the 2024 decline reflects **incomplete data (up to August)**, not a collapse.

## 📊 Dashboard 2: Customer & Marketing Analysis  
🎯 **How effective are campaigns and customer engagement?**  

![Customer_&_Marketing_Analysis](https://github.com/Osisehh/Performance-Dashboard/blob/main/Images/Dashboard%202.jpg)


**KPIs (YoY):**  
- Views: **45K → 46K (+1.2%) → 31K (-32.7% YTD 2024)**  
- Conversion Rate: **6.1% → 6.18% → 6.1%**  
- Satisfaction: **47.6% → 49.7% → 45.7%**  

**Key Visuals & Insights:**  
- **Top Campaigns:** Winter Promo 2023 ($133K) & Spring Promo 2024 ($141K)  
- **Plans:** Basic plan dominates (**~75–78% of revenue**)  
- **Lead Sources:** Email consistently the top driver (>$140K annually)  
- **ROI:** Strong campaigns peak at ~30%, weaker ones dip to ~21%  

**Key Takeaway:**  
Marketing delivers **consistent ROI**, but growth is slow. Heavy reliance on the **basic plan** and **email campaigns** is both a **strength and risk**.
